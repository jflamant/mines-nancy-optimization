# Introduction

In this chapter, we will have a look at the basics of optimization, trying to answer these simple (but essential) questions:
- What is an optimization problem? 
- How do we formulate an optimization problem?
- What are typical optimization problems, and do we recognize them?

:::{important} Key notions of the chapter
- terminology of optimization: objective function, constraints, discrete vs continuous, etc. 
- learn the difference between local, global or strict minimizers, etc. 
- standard optimization problems: linear program (LP), quadratic program (QP), etc. 
- displaying information: plotting functions values and contours with Python
