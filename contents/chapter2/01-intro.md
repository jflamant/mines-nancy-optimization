# Introduction

In this chapter, we consider optimization problems of the form 
$$\label{eq:optim}
\min_{{x} \in \Omega} f({x})
$$
Recall from the previous chapter that when $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^n$ the problem [](#eq:optim) the problem is said to be unconstrained; otherwise, if $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, we say that [](#eq:optim) is a constrained optimization problem. 

:::{important} Key notions of the chapter
- Review of elementary results from multivariable calculus and algebra
- Notions of **gradient**, **Hessian**, and **convexity**
- **Existence** and **uniqueness** results for minimizers
- For **unconstrained problems**, necessary and sufficient **optimality conditions** for a point to be a minimizer.
