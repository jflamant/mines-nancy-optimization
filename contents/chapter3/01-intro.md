title: Least-squares problems
--- 

# Introduction

In this chapter, we study a particular optimization problem known as **least squares**.

It is a very important problem because:

- It is often the first approach used, for example in inverse problems.
- It can be derived statistically from a Gaussian noise assumption.
- It lays the foundation for many more sophisticated procedures.
- Under some conditions, it admits an explicit (closed-form) solution.

:::{note}
Throughout the chapter, we will consider **unconstrained optimization** problems only.

:::{important} Key notions of the chapter
- Several use-cases of (linear) least squares problems.
- Conditions for uniqueness of solutions.
- How to compute an explicit solution.
- **lab work:** Practical implementation of least-squares problems, with an introduction to the notion of regularization.
