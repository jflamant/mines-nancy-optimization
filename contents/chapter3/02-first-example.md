# A first example: linear regression


Let us assume we are observing some data $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$ as a function of a variable $x$ as depicted in the following plot:

```{code-cell} python
:tags: [hide-input]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(2025)
beta0 = 1
beta1 = 1.5

n = 30
x = np.linspace(0, 10, n)
y = beta0 + beta1 * x + 1.2*np.random.randn(n)

plt.scatter(x, y, label="measurement $y_i$")
plt.xlabel(r"$x$")
plt.ylabel(r"$y$")
plt.ylim(0, 20)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Formulating the optimization problem 

Suppose we are interested in finding a straightforward mathematical relationship that links the input (or explanatory) variables $x_i$ to the observed data points $y_i$. In other words, we want to model how the measurements $y_i$ depend on the values of $x_i$. This process is known as regression analysis, and in this example, we will focus on linear regression, which assumes that the relationship between $x_i$ and $y_i$ can be well-approximated by a straight line, or in mathematical terms:
$$y_i \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i\quad \text{ where }(\beta_0, \beta_1) \text{ are unknown model parameters}$$


Let’s construct an objective function in the parameters $(\beta_0, \beta_1)$. A first simple choice is to measure the error (or residual) between the model and the observations using a quadratic function
$$\varepsilon_i(\beta_0, \beta_1) = (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2$$
leading to the *total* model error
$$\varepsilon(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2.$$


For a fixed data vector $y = [y_1, \ldots, y_n]^\top$ and known explanatory variables $x = [x_1, \ldots, x_n]^\top$, we obtain the following unconstrained optimization problem in terms of $\beta = [\beta_0, \beta_1]^\top$: 
:::{math}
:label:eq:linear_reg_example_intro_chap_LS
\begin{array}{ll}
\minimize& \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 x_i)^2\\
\st & \beta \in \mathbb{R}^2
\end{array}

This is a **linear least squares** problem. This type of problem is found in many applications, such as engineering, econometrics, image processing, etc.  

## Computing the solution

**Linear regression** is widely used across many fields, and there are numerous readily available tools for computing solutions. The goal of this chapter is to look under the hood of such tools. In the meantime, here's how to solve the problem [](#eq:linear_reg_example_intro_chap_LS) using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): 

```{code-cell} python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Reshape x for scikit-learn
X = x.reshape(-1, 1)
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# Extract coefficients
beta0_hat = model.intercept_
beta1_hat = model.coef_[0]

print(f"Estimated coefficients: beta0 = {beta0_hat:.2f}, beta1 = {beta1_hat:.2f}")
print(f"Ground truth coefficients: beta0 = {beta0:.2f}, beta1 = {beta1:.2f}")

# Display the fitted line
plt.scatter(x, y, label="measurement $y_i$")
plt.plot(x, beta0_hat + beta1_hat * x, color="red", label="estimated model")
plt.plot(x, beta0 + beta1 * x, color="green", linestyle='--', label="ground truth")

plt.xlabel(r"$x$")
plt.ylabel(r"$y$")
plt.ylim(0, 20)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
