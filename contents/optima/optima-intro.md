# Chapter 2: Caracterization of optimal points

In this chapter, we consider optimization problems of the form 
$$\label{eq:optim}
\min_{\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{C}} f(\mathbf{x})
$$
Recall from the previous chapter that when $\mathcal{C} = \mathbf{R}^N$ the problem [](#eq:optim) the problem is said to be unconstrained; otherwise, if $\mathcal{C} \subset \mathbf{R}^N$, we say that [](#eq:optim) is a constrained optimization problem. 

### Key notions of the chapter
- Review of elementary results from multivariable calculus and algebra
- Notions of **gradient**, **Hessian**, and **convexity**
- **Existence** and **uniqueness** results for minimizers
- For **unconstrained problems**, necessary and sufficient **optimality conditions** for a point to be a minimizer.
