# Lab Work

One of the goals of this course is to implement practical optimization algorithms in Python. 

In this course, we will use Jupyter Notebooks because they allow to combine code, visualizations, and explanations in a single interactive document. Notebooks make it easy to experiment with algorithms, document your process, and share results with others.

:::{note} How to run the notebooks?
You have two options:
- **Google Colab**: Requires a Google account. The notebook runs in the cloud, so no Python installation is needed. Don't forget to save your  Jupyter Notebook first!
- **locally**: Download the notebook and run it on your computer using JupyterLab or similar software. This requires a working local installation of Python, including NumPy and Matplotlib. You'll need to know (at least a little) how to manage dependencies.

:::{important} Instructions for Lab Work
- Write your answers directly in the notebook using Markdown. Don't know how? See a cheatsheet [here](https://markdownlivepreview.dev/cheatsheet).
- Comment your code **thoroughly**.
- Unsure how a function works? Check the documentation for NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.
